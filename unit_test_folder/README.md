# Problem/Examples

## Problem
Define the Problem

Write up a strategy for writing a Reference Based PCR Duplicate Removal tool. That is, given a sorted sam file of uniquely mapped reads, remove all PCR duplicates (retain only a single copy of each read). Develop a strategy that avoids loading everything into memory. You should not write any code for this portion of the assignment. Be sure to:
- Define the problem
- Write examples:
    - Include a properly formated sorted input sam file
    - Include a properly formated expected output sam file
- Develop your algorithm using pseudocode
- Determine high level functions
    - Description
    - Function headers
    - Test examples (for individual functions)
    - Return statement
    

## Test Examples
What I am testing in input_test.sam: 
- Does the proposed algorithm make sense to you? Can you follow the logic?
- Does the algorithm do everything it's supposed to do? (see part 1)
- Are proposed functions reasonable? Are they "standalone" pieces of code?
